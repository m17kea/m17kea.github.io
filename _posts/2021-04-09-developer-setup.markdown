One of the most daunting parts of starting on the journey of becoming a software developer is picking the right equipment and platform. You've heard of Windows and MacOS, maybe even Linux but you've probably then glazed over at the plethora of laptops available when you google 'Which is the best laptop to buy?'. The truth is that all have their merit and there is a time and place to use all of them. Any laptop can be configured as a dev machine but unless you know exactly what you are doing, there will come a time where you end up on the wrong google result, with the wrong advice that when followed, will disable the built-in security of your system. 

Apple security vs MS

In my humble opinion your safest option is a Mac. Apple starts out as the most secure and private environment from the moment you first open the lid and it is the least likely to allow you to do something really scary with your security features.

- Brew
- AWS CLI
- GitHub CLI
- Dotnet SDK
